### TRACTIAN FRONTEND CHALLENGE

This is my submission for the tractian frontend challenge.

It is a fully-responsive, performatic, and hopefully beautifully implemented version of the figma prototype.

Hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed implementing it! :smile:

To run:
```
npx http-server
```

This will serve the html, by default the url will be:
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

The project was built using only html, css, and JS. The only lib is http-server, to allow use of JS Modules.

I have debated using TypeScript, but given the scope of the project, and the fact that I will probably not maintain it after release, I decided not to go with it.
